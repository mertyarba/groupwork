The purpose of this project is to provide the users with a platform where they can keep track of their tasks. The paper and pen method is for grandpas, and you know it.
So why not do it online where it stays forever? Unless you delete it.

We differ from other applications like this online with our rule of simplicity. Everything you need is a click away, making the process faster since our target
audience is people who want fast and direct access to their tasks. Other applications that are similar: Google Tasks, Evernote...

Functionalities:
-Users can sign up and log in.
-Users can add tasks to their to-do lists.
-Users can delete the tasks individually.

Summary: We learnt that when coding typos are unacceptable. You have to have a clear vision of your functions and what you want your app to do.
We faced problems such as creating the right functions, creating connection to the database, adding the ability to delete items because of typos. Lots of typos.
